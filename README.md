Overview

The Odds Scraper is a concept repository that explores the idea of exploiting multiple betting websites to discover +EV (Expected Value) bets. This project focuses on scraping odds data from various betting websites. Please note that this concept is for educational purposes only, and any actual use may violate the terms of service of these websites.

Scraping Multiple Betting Websites:  
The project aims to scrape odds data from multiple betting websites to identify potentially profitable bets.  

Avoiding Security Measures:  
It employs a technique of using mobile endpoints with minimal security measures to avoid common restrictions such as Cloudflare protection and other limits.  

Data Comparison:  
While this  concept focuses on the scraping aspect, a future development step would involve creating a global format for all websites' odds data to compare and identify the best odds for a specific bet.

Getting Started

As a concept repository, this project does not provide a fully functional odds scraper. To create a practical odds scraper for personal or educational use, you would need to:

Identify Betting Websites: Choose the betting websites you want to scrape odds data from. Be aware that scraping websites may violate their terms of service.

Implement Scraping: Develop a scraping mechanism for each website, targeting the odds data you need.

Data Standardization: Create a common format to standardize odds data from different websites, making it easier to compare and identify the best odds.

Analysis and Betting Strategy: Implement a strategy to analyze the odds data and identify +EV bets based on your criteria.
